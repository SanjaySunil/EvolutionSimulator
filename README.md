# Evolution Simulator

A program developed for my A-level Computer Science non-examined assessment. This simulator models the principles of evolution through natural selection, allowing users to observe the dynamics of species adaptation over generations.

## Features

- **Simulation of Evolutionary Processes**: Visualize how species evolve over time based on genetic traits.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Engage with the simulation via an intuitive interface.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust simulation settings, including mutation rates and environmental factors.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content and interactivity.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SanjaySunil/EvolutionSimulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EvolutionSimulator
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Run the simulator using:
```bash
npm start
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start the simulation.
